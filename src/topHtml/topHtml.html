    <h1>3 Cool Html 5 Features</h1>
    <article class="elements" ng-mouseover="hoverIn()" ng-mouseleave="hoverOut()">
        <legend>New Elements</legend>
        <p>
            The new HTML5 elements allow for clear, cleaner code.</BR>
            In HTML 4 the div was the main element used to divide different sections of the document,
            the div was usually coupled with a CSS class and that was the way we had to separate logically different sections.
            This meant that when you looked at your code all you saw where a lot of divs, and it wasn't clear at all what were
            the different thematic sections of a document.</BR>
            Now with HTML 5 we have new elements like &lt;header&gt; &lt;footer&gt; &lt;aside&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;article&gt; and &lt;nav&gt;.</BR>
            Just by using this new elements I feel my code is much cleaner
            and easy to understand for me and for any other developer that might have to work with my code.</BR>
            Other benefits are accessibility, this makes it easier on screen readers to interpret the web page for disabled people.

    <header class="header">HEADER</header>
    <footer class="footer">FOOTER</footer>
    <article class="content-editable">
        <legend>Inline editing with contenteditable</legend>
        <p contenteditable>
            Contenteditable is great, I used to add external libraries to my projects to be able to do inline editing.
            Now with the HTML5 contenteditable attribute is super simple, all you need to do is an attribute to any element and done you have inline editing.
            Just click on this text and you'll see what I mean.

    <article class="audio-video">
        <legend>Audio & Video</legend>
        <p>
            HTML 5 introduced native audio and video files support, now all you need to do reproduce a video or play an audio file is to use the new
            &lt;video&gt; &lt;audio&gt; elements. No more need for iframes or heavy external libraries.
            Theres even an api to control playback with javascript.
            Heres a video of another cool HTML5 feature:
        </p>
        <video preload in-view="$ctrl.playVideo($inviewInfo)">
            <source src="video/canvas.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <p> Your browser is old. <a href="video/canvas.mp4">Download this video instead.</a> </p>
        </video>

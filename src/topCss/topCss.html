    <h1>3 CSS3 modules that are really useful</h1>
    <article class="animations">
        <legend>Animations and Transitions</legend>
        <p>
            Animations used to involve javascript and particulary animations using jQuery wich is pretty common are a bit slow.
            With the new animations module its simplier and more performant to decorate your project with animantions and transitions.
            Animations involve @keyframes wich hold the properties at a given point in time, then you have to indicate to wich element you want to apply the animation to,
            you set an animation-name and animation-duration and thats about it.
            Transitions are even easier, as the name implies, it involves the tranasition form one css property state to another, all you need to do
            is specify wich proprty of the element you want to transition and over how much time.
            here are some simple examples.
        </p>
        <div class="examples">
            <span class="circle"></span>
            <span class="square"></span>
        </div>
    </article>
    <article class="media-queries">
        <legend>Responsive web sites with media queries</legend>
        <p>
            With media queries we can create one site and adapt the look and feel for any device of any size.
            You can write a set of css rules for a view-port size and another completly different for another size,
            adapting your designs for different screen sizes and devices.
            Try resizing this page now and you'll see an example.

    <article class="selectors">
        <legend>New selectors</legend>
        <p>
            CSS3 introduces new selectors, now we can avoid giving id's to every single element in our document just for styling purposes.
            Most important giving styles to dynamically created elements is now easy, when before sometimes involved complicated math to,
            for example count children elements.
            Here we set a background-color for all even li of a ul element when we hover over this element just using css!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Child 1</li>
            <li>Child 2</li>
            <li>Child 3</li>
            <li>Child 4</li>
        </ul>

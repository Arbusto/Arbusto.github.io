    <h1>3 ways of optimizing a web site</h1>
    <article class="cache">
        <legend>Fewer Request and Caching</legend>
        <p>
            Reducing the amount of request, and caching the remaing ones is one of the best ways to optimize your web site.
            This can be achived by setting either an expiration date, an expiration time, a modification date
            or a unique identification (etag) in your request headers, personally I prefer the max-age method.

    <article class="concat-and-minify">
        <legend>Concatenating and minifying css and js files</legend>
        <p>
            Concatenating means chaining all your javascripts or css files into one big file,
            of course having all your code in one big file while you are developing is a terrible idea.
            But once the site is ready to be published this is one of the best things you could do for your web site.
            Minifing is also importnant, this eliminates white spaces, and modifies the scripts in numerous ways to make the scripts smaller.
            There are a couple of different tools to achive this, I personally do this automatically with task automation tools (grunt or gulp).
            Another thing to remember is that loading scripts is a render-blocking activity, that's why loading scripts at the very end of the document,
            before the body element closing tag is recommended (when possible).
            Even better if possible using the async attribute in your js scrips will help a lot, or even if your js is small enough loading it inline.

        <legend>Compressing images</legend>
        <p>
            Another often overlooked optimization is compressing images, images are big assets and using compression on them makes a bit of a difference.
            there are a lot of tools that do lossless compression of images.
            Also moving all your assets to a CDN, a server specially designed for handling and delivering assests is another great idea
            that will make a site run a lot faster.
